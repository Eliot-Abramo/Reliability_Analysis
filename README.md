# Reliability_Analysis

In this repository you will find:
1. Reliability_Total - Contains all of the components for the entire project, can be filtered using the Sheet tab (i.e for components in the Power Block you will take anything that has /Project Architecture/Power/*)
2. Reliability_Max_Min - Contains the max and min values for the components that have values that can alternate. Note this is not all components. Also note for the tables there is no Max for Table 17 and no min for Table 18. This is due to constraints from the manufacturer.
